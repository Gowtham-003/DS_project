2. Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income such as hiring.
3. Companies spend 15%-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate.
4. An average company loses anywhere between 1% and 2.5% of their total revenue on the time it takes to bring a new hire up to speed.
5. It takes 52 days on average to fill a position.
